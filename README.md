# SVEP
Semantic model for variants evolution prediction (SVEP) is a sequence prediction tool specializing in forecasting SARS-CoV-2 variants and essential amino acid substitutions within virus evolution. Its framework can be adapted for predicting mutations in other virus sequences given sufficient sequence data. The most commendabel feature of SVEP is its prediction could be purely based on sequence information and only requires minimial computational power (eg. personal desktop).
